          I've always been interested in Tech for as long as I can remember, but
          ive always heard about how difficult it is, so I've always wondered if
          i could do it. July of 2021, I started learning on my own from Youtube
          videos and i can remember the joy on my face when i printed my first
          "Hello World". I heard about Altschool and i joined Altschool in
          November of 2021, it was not easy juggling between tech and work, but
          it worked out in the end. I'm enthusiastic and very passionate about
          software development. I am passionate about building solutions and
          innovative ideas to make life easier and better using modern
          technology tools.
          I'm experienced in building fast and scalable apps from start to finish. 
          Here are some languages I'm working on.

          So, if you are looking for a dedicated and creative developer who is passionate about solving algorithms, you've got the right person!
